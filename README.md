# Golf Stats

Golf stats is a java desktop app that allows users to enter all the shots the hit during a round of golf and 
give them feedback at the end on how they performed in each of the four main strokes gained categories.
These four main categories are off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.

Currently the software is used by running the main java file through an IDE that supports java.
