# Golf Stats

Golf stats is a java desktop app that allows users to enter all the shots the hit during a round of golf and 
give them feedback at the end on how they performed in each of the four main strokes gained categories.
These four main categories are off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.

Currently the software is used by running the main java file through an IDE that supports java.

Once you start the software you have the option to enter data for a round of 9 holes or 18 holes.
From there you first mark the distance of the hole and then for each subsequent shot you will enter
the distance you have from the pin and what lie your ball is in. You continue this process untill you have filled out
the selected amount of holes. Once you finish the round the strokeds gained stats are provided to you
to help show what areas of your game needs improvement.
